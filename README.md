# Project Title: Booking system

## Overview

This **Booking System** is a web application designed for clinic appointment scheduling. It allows users to **book appointments**, **sign up** for accounts, and **track booking details** or **dashboard based on roles**. The project uses a React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database, and is deployed on AWS.

## Technologies Used

### **Frontend**

- React
- TypeScript
- Axios (for API calls)

### **Backend**

- Node.js (without a framework)
- PostgreSQL

### **CI/CD**

- GitHub Actions

### **Infrastructure**

- AWS (EC2, S3, CloudFront, CloudWatch)
- Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)

### **Environment Variables**

- .env files are used for local configurations.
- GitHub Secrets store sensitive data for CI/CD pipelines.

### **Testing**

- Jest _(planned for unit testing with 95%+ coverage)_

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or Yarn (for managing dependencies)

## Running the Backend

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/teresa2625/booking-system-backend.git
cd booking-system-backend
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

3. Start the backend server:

```
yarn start
```

This will start the backend server, and it will be running on http://localhost:5000 by default.

## Running the Frontend

Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory (if it's in a separate folder):

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/teresa2625/booking-system-frontend.git
cd booking-system-frontend
```

2. Install the frontend dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

3. Start the frontend development server:

```
yarn start
```

This will run the frontend server, and it will be available at http://localhost:3000 by default.

Now, you can access the application by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in your browser. The frontend will interact with the backend to allow booking appointment and display dashboard.
